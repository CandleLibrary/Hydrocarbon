<h3 align=center>Parser Compiler</h3>

<p align=center> <sub><b>v0.6.0</b></sub> </p>


Reads custom **.hcg** grammar files and builds recursive descent parsers. Currently supports parser targets for Javascript, Typescript, and WebAssembly

## Usage

#### Write A Grammar

```ini
# my_json_like_language.hcg
@IGNORE g:ws g:nl

<> JSON > object                                   

<> value > object
    | array
    | t:true                                        f:r{ true }
    | t:false                                       f:r{ false }
    | t:null                                        f:r{ null }
    | tk:number                                     f:r{ parseFloat($sym1) }
    | tk:string                                     f:r{ $sym1.slice(1,-1) }

<> object > \{  element(*\, )  \}                   f:r{ Object.fromEntries($$sym2 || [])  }

<> element > tk:string \: value                     f:r{ [$sym1.slice(1,-1), $sym3] }

<> array > \[ value(*\, ) \]                        f:r{ $$sym2 || [] }

<> number > g:num ( \. g:num )? ( \e g:num )?

<> string > \" (RST g:nl) ( g:id | g:num | g:sym )(*) \"
```


#### Install Hydrocarbon & Compile Parser
```bash
:~$ yarn global add @candlefw/hydrocarbon

:~$ hydrocarbon compile --recognizer wasm --completer js \./my_json_like_language.hcg
```

#### Use Parser

```js
import json_parse from "./parser.js";

const { result } = json_parse('{"Hello World":[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9.265] }');

result[0]        // => { 'Hello World' : [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9.265]  }
typeof result[0] // => "object"

```

# Motivation

The primary reason this exists is to provide a flexible, easy to use parser compiler to handle the parsing demands of CandleFW libraries such as Wick, JS, TS, Wax, and CSS. It provides a way of rapidly define new language syntax and is able combine grammars of different languages into one meta-parser. 

# Parser Design

The core functionality of a Hydrocarbon parser is split across two major parts, a **recognizer** and a **completer**. 

The **recognizer** performs the heavy lifting by parsing a text input, identifying sequences of text that belong to productions of the grammar, and generating parse actions. There are four actions the recognizer can issue: ACCEPT, SHIFT, REDUCE, and SKIP. These actions are encoded in 32bit integers and stored in an action buffer. 

The **completer** reads actions from the action buffer, and applies them to the text input. It may also call user defined functions that accepts tokens generated by SHIFT actions. These functions may optionally return values that can be received by other custom functions. Both tokens, and values returned from the custom functions, get pushed to an output stack, which then returned by the **completer** once it finishes applying the parse actions. A primary use of the **completer** is to construct ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) from the text input, but it can be used for other tasks such as generating text highlighting or serving as a script interpreter.

The split functions allow the **recognizer** to be defined using C/C++ friendly syntax that is then compiled to a WASM module. The **completer** is written in TypeScrip/JavaScript. Future work will allow both the completer and the recognizer to be used in  languages other than TypeScript/JavaScript.
